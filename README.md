A MangoBot

MangoBot is a fun personal bot for myself, and friends. This github will be being public for a while and then private the next second, which might be because we are testing the software


If you want to run this, you can run the main.js in VSCode. Make sure to have your token in config.json. Do not mess with the node modules, package.json because even we dont know what they do.
