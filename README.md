A MangoBot

MangoBot is a fun personal bot for myself, and friends. This github will be being public for a while and then private the next second, which might be because we are testing the software


If you want to run this, you can run the main.js in VSCode. Make sure to have your token in config.json. Do not mess with the node modules, package.json because even we don't know what they do.


## FOR MAC

Open Terminal, and then type cd, put a space and then drag the MangoBot folder into the terminal window. Type in 'node main.js' which will activate the bot. You should see a message that says Bot Is Online or something like that.

## FOR WINDOWS

coming soon

## FOR LINUX

coming soon

##UPDATE

We will be working on an application with all of these features, and all you have to do is input your own token, choose your prefix, and press start. We are still working on the application, and we will be thankful to any contributions.
