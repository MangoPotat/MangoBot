This bot is mostly for personal use, but you can download the software and use it for yourself.

# HOW TO RUN

The software itself will not contain a bot token. You can create one yourself from the Discord Developer Portal

You can insert the token into config.json. You can also change the prefix in config.json

Other than that, everything else is done. You can edit some of the code in main.js. DO NOT EDIT THE package-lock.json OR package.json OR node_modules. It will seriously like kill itself. You will have to have node installed on your computer. 

Easiest way to run is to open main.js in Visual Studio Code and run in "Run and Debug"


You will have to invite the bot to your server, and you can search that up on youtube. Im too lazy to write down the steps here.
